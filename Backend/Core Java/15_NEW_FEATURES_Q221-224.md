Java 5 (1.5) introduced generics, enhanced for-loop, autoboxing/unboxing, typesafe enums, varargs, annotations, static import, and concurrency utilities (`java.util.concurrent`).

**Key Theoretical Concepts:**
- Language-level generics and syntactic sugar improvements

**Interviewer Expectation:**
Should list main features and their impact on code clarity and safety.

**Depth Expected:** Beginner to Intermediate

### 222. WHAT ARE THE NEW FEATURES IN JAVA 6?

**Expected Answer :**
Java 6 focused on JVM and library improvements rather than language changes: scripting support (JSR 223), improvements to JDBC, compiler API, and performance enhancements.

**Key Theoretical Concepts:**
- Standard library and tooling evolution

**Interviewer Expectation:**
Should know Java 6 had smaller language changes but ecosystem improvements.

**Depth Expected:** Beginner

### 223. WHAT ARE THE NEW FEATURES IN JAVA 7?

**Expected Answer :**
Java 7 added try-with-resources, diamond operator `<>`, multi-catch, strings in switch, `NIO.2` (Path API), and `ForkJoinPool`.

**Key Theoretical Concepts:**
- Resource management improvements and concurrency additions

**Interviewer Expectation:**
Should mention try-with-resources and multi-catch as important ergonomics.

**Depth Expected:** Intermediate

### 224. WHAT ARE THE NEW FEATURES IN JAVA 8?

**Expected Answer :**
Java 8 brought lambda expressions, method references, streams API, `Optional`, new date/time API (`java.time`), default and static methods in interfaces, and `CompletableFuture`.

**Key Theoretical Concepts:**
- Functional programming constructs and a richer concurrency toolkit

**Interviewer Expectation:**
A 2-year developer should be comfortable with lambdas and streams and know `Optional` use-cases.

**Red Flags:**
- Not knowing basic Java 8 features like lambdas/streams

**Depth Expected:** Intermediate

## FINAL INTERVIEW NOTE

Service-based companies focus on conceptual clarity and the ability to explain how JavaScript works internally rather than advanced library knowledge.

You should be able to explain execution flow, scope, async behavior, and real-time usage clearly.

This document can be used as a last-day revision checklist for JavaScript interviews.

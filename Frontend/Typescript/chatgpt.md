## FINAL INTERVIEW NOTE

Interviewers expect clear understanding of how TypeScript adds safety on top of JavaScript and how it helps prevent runtime errors at compile time.

You should be able to explain types, interfaces, generics, and real-time usage confidently.

This document can be used as a last-day revision checklist for TypeScript interviews.
